<!-- •	As a user, I want to see a responsive layout showing the post 
  title, author, publication date, image banner, and post content from the API.
•	As a user, I want each blog page to have a shareable 
URL including a query string or hash parameter that contains the post ID, 
so I can share the post with others easily. -->
